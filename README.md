# Expense Tracker App: Overview

## Deployment
This app is being deployed using Netlify  


## Motivation Behind Project 
As a university student it is very important to be able to keep track of where I am spending my money. Many of the expense tracking websites and apps
either lack functionality or in design.  
I decided to create an expense tracking app that has both the functionality and the design.  
This project was also a great chance for me to learn the Mantine UI library.
